To use this you will need:

2. In the resources folder, create a copy of app.asar and rename it to input.asar

3. Move input.asar to the asar-patcher folder

4. Run patch.bat

(You will know the patching was finished when "Saved" is written to your console)

5. A new file will be created named app.asar, replace the app.asar in the resources folder with the newly created one

6. If the patching was succsesful, Sploit will be in your client
